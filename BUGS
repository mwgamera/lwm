we're possibly being a bit overzealous about maintaining the window stack,
with lots of flickering windows as a result. it's particularly noticeable
when you're running a desktop - but then that's a stupid thing to do anyway.
not sure how to fix it without maintaining a lot more data about the window
stack.

reported by corey holcomb-hockin: lwm producues messages like this when popups appear:
lwm: protocol request X_ConfigureWindow on resource 0xa0000e failed: 
BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
lwm: protocol request X_SendEvent on resource 0xa0000e failed: BadWindow

martin and elliott still have window problems with edit, although it's
better than it was. apparently the window is now placed correctly,
but gets larger between successive runs. i can't reproduce this,
unfortunately.

gtk applications window titles are empty with gtk+ 2.4.x (reported by peter hartlitch).
