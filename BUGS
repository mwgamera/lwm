we're possibly being a bit overzealous about maintaining the window stack,
with lots of flickering windows as a result. it's particularly noticeable
when you're running a desktop - but then that's a stupid thing to do anyway.
not sure how to fix it without maintaining a lot more data about the window
stack.

reported by corey holcomb-hockin: lwm producues messages like this when popups appear:
lwm: protocol request X_ConfigureWindow on resource 0xa0000e failed:

martin and elliott still have window problems with edit, although it's
better than it was. apparently the window is now placed correctly,
but gets larger between successive runs. i can't reproduce this,
unfortunately.

chris reports that positioning a window on the bottom or right edge of a screen
and then resizing the edge opposite to that touching the edge of the screen
causes the window to jump in 1 unit (pixel or character depending on the
application). also, and possibly related, holding button 1 to resize any edge
apart from the right, and then moving the mouse along that edge (ie.
perpendicular to the normal movement for resizing) causes the window to shrink
one unit.
