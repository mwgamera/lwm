Description: Lightweight Window Manager
 lwm is a window manager for X that tries to keep out of your face.
 There are no icons, no button bars, no icon docks, no root menus,
 no nothing: if you want all that, then other programs can provide
 it. There's no configurability either: if you want that, you want a
 different window manager; one that helps your operating system in
 its evil conquest of your disc space and its annexation of your
 physical memory.
