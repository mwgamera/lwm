.SH NAME
lwm \- Lightweight Window Manager for the X Window System
.SH SYNTAX
\fBlwm \fP[ \fB\-s\fP \fIsession-id\fP ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fILwm\fP is a window manager for the X Window System. It provides enough
features to allow the user to manage their windows, and no more.
.PP
Windows are surrounded by a frame with a 
titlebar at the top next to a small box. The frame is a grey colour for
all windows except that which has the input focus, where it is black.
.PP
In the default configuration, \fIlwm\fP uses the enter-to-focus scheme, where
moving the pointer into a window gives that window the input focus.
\fILwm\fP may also be configured to use the click-to-focus scheme, where a
window must be clicked on (with any button) to receive the input focus. Clicking
on a window in this mode causes the window to be raised. Note that a click
used to focus a window is always swallowed by \fIlwm\fP, so clicking a
button in a new window requires two clicks.
.PP
A button 1 click on a window frame brings that window to the top. Dragging
button 1 on the frame of a resizable window repositions that edge of
the window. If a corner rather than an edge is dragged, then both edges
forming the corner are repositioned. While you're reshaping a window,
a little window pops up to show you the window's current size.
.PP
In the default configuration, button 1 on the root window does nothing.
.PP
Button 2 is used to drag a window by its frame, repositioning the window
but maintaining its position in the window stack.
.PP
In the default configuration, button 2 on the root window brings up a
new shell.
.PP
A button 3 click on a window frame hides that window.  Pressing
button 3 on the root window brings up a menu of all the hidden windows.
Releasing the button while over an item will unhide the named window.
.PP
A button 3 click in the frame while Shift is held down pushes the window
to the back, under any other windows. (Users with 4-button mice are
encouraged to use their fourth button for this function.)
.PP
A click with any button inside the little white box in a window's frame
can be used to close the window.
